# K-Means Clustering on Iris Dataset: An Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the Iris dataset using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of the K-Means algorithm with varying numbers of clusters (k=2, k=3, and k=4). The results are assessed using a variety of metrics.

## Project Overview

The [Iris dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html) is a multivariate dataset introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher. It consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers. Four features were measured from each sample: the lengths and the widths of the sepals and petals.

In this project, I try to apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to this dataset and evaluate its performance with different numbers of clusters.
