# K-Means Clustering on Iris Dataset: An Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the Iris dataset using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of the K-Means algorithm with varying numbers of clusters (k=2, k=3, and k=4). The results are assessed using a variety of metrics.
